# Scripts Removed

The scripts that were previously in this folder have been removed from the miniapp template as they are not necessary for deployed applications.

If you need to reference or extract these scripts for use in other packages, they are available in commit:

**Last commit with scripts:** `e889c16063e3676681fba414e36eff554e5895a0`
